description: Add context to current work (not a new task)
---
This is additional context for what you're currently working on.

**Context provided:** $ARGUMENTS

**Instructions:**
1. If you're actively working on something: incorporate this context immediately into your current task. Acknowledge briefly: "Got it: [summary]"

2. If you're idle (no active task): treat this as a new task to start now. Say "Starting: [summary]" and begin working.

This is NOT a queued task. Act on it immediately.
