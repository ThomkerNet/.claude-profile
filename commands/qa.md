description: Add task to current work scope (do it now, alongside current task)
---
Expand the current task to also include this work.

**Task to add:** $ARGUMENTS

**Instructions:**
1. If you're actively working on something:
   - Acknowledge: "Adding to scope: [summary]"
   - Incorporate this into your current task immediately
   - Do NOT add to queue.md - this is part of current work now

2. If you're idle (no active task):
   - Treat this as a new task to start immediately
   - Say "Starting: [summary]" and begin working

This is NOT deferred. Act on it as part of your current work.
