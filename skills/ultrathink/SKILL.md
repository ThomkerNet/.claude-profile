# Ultra Think Mode

You are now in **extended thinking mode**. Use the `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool to work through this problem systematically.

## Instructions

1. **Break down the problem** into discrete analytical steps
2. **Use sequential thinking** with adequate thought count (start with 5-10, extend as needed)
3. **Consider alternatives** - branch and revise thoughts as understanding deepens
4. **Generate and verify hypotheses** before concluding
5. **Express uncertainty** where it exists rather than guessing

## When to Use Each Feature

| Feature | When |
|---------|------|
| `isRevision: true` | Reconsidering a previous conclusion |
| `branchFromThought` | Exploring alternative approaches |
| `needsMoreThoughts` | Realizing more analysis needed at "end" |

## Process

```
1. Initial analysis → estimate thought count
2. Work through systematically → adjust count as needed
3. Generate hypothesis → verify against steps
4. If uncertain → branch or revise
5. Conclude only when confident
```

## Output

After completing sequential thinking:
1. Summarize the key insights from your analysis
2. Present conclusions with confidence levels
3. Note any remaining uncertainties or areas needing investigation

**Begin your extended analysis now using the sequential thinking tool.**
